# HOW TO RUN

I've made a script named run.sh that will take care of compilation, and running. Execute it with...

```bash
./run.sh
```

## Alternative

If the script mentioned above doesnt work, follow these steps to compile and execute my project.

1. Compile the project with...

```bash
gcc ./p2.c
```

2. Execute the binary file (with optional command line arguments, see arguments section)

```bash
./a.out <arguments>
```

# Arguments (WIP)

All arguments will get printed out in the 'Process command line arguments' section like so

```
[Satisfying Requirement]: 'Process command line arguments'
------------------------------
Listing arguments...
        arg0: ./a.out
        arg1: with
        arg2: some
        arg3: args
```
